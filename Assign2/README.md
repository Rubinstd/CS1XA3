# Assignment 2 - Elm CV / App

## Elm CV

For my CV I decided to use a few different external resources. I used the 2 external stylesheets and one custom font was imported. Most of my work was done with the w3 schools stylesheet while following along with some of their example templates and editing it to fit a style I prefered. Links to all of these resources can be found here:
[W3-Schools Stylesheet] (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css)
[Custom Font] (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto)
[Other external stylesheet] (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css)

I decided to go with a w3-card based theme. I liked that it was very minimalist and kept information nicely separate. It allows the user to read through and clearly understand what each section is about and where it ends. I also used a variety of fa fa icons from the w3-schools css just to pretty up the page.
