# Assignment 3 - Haskell Math Library

## General

This is my haskell math library. It is able to take an evaluate, simplify, partially differentiate, and parse a variety of different expressions. It supports numerous operations as can be found within the ExprType.hs file. A few custom functions I added were vectors that take a list of expressions (and with them included is a vector evaluator, dot product calculator, and a cross product for 3 dimensional vectors calculator, all can be found within the ExprDiff.hs file). Throughout the process of this project I also referenced a few different resources including:

[Template for all the files found here](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~dalvescb/#outline-container-org2a5d6f3)

[My method of quickCheck was graciously provided by Sam whose github can be found here](https://github.com/cymbalus/CS1XA3)

Included with my files is haddock documentation for all of the features within the files (along with additional information to be found within the actual code itself).
